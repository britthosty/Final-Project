	<p>	Everyone feels anxious now and then. It is a normal emotion. Many people feel nervous
	when faced with a problem at work, before taking a test, or making an important decision.
	Anxiety disorders are different, though. They can cause such distress that it interferes 
	with your ability to lead a normal life.

	Anxiety Disorders and Anxiety Attacks</a></p>
	<p>	It's normal to feel anxious when facing a challenging situation, such as a job interview, 
	a tough exam, or a blind date. But if your worries and fears seem overwhelming and interfere 
	with your daily life, you may be suffering from an anxiety disorder. There are many different 
	types of anxiety disorders-and many effective treatments and self-help strategies. Once you 
	understand your anxiety disorder, there are steps you can take to reduce your symptoms and 
	regain control of your life.

	Many people with anxiety experience symptoms of more than one type of anxiety disorder, and may 
	experience depression as well. It's important to seek support early if you're experiencing anxiety. 
	Your symptoms may not go away on their own and if left untreated, they can start to take over your life.

	There are many types of anxiety disorders with their own unique sets of symptoms. 
	Some of these disorders include panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD),
	social phobia (or social anxiety disorder), specific phobias, and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).

<p>The terms anxiety attacks and panic attacks are often used interchangeably to mean the same thing. In this sense, the difference is purely a matter of semantics. However, this is not true when we look at these terms from a clinical perspective, in which case panic and anxiety are defined by different features.

>Difference between Anxiety Disorders and normal anxiety</a></p>
<p>	Anxiety is hardwired into all of our brains. It is part of the body's "fight or flight" response. 
This prepares us to act quickly in the face of danger. It is a normal response to situations of uncertainty, 
trouble or feeling unprepared. However, if common everyday events bring on severe and persistent anxiety or 
panic that interferes with life, you may have an anxiety disorder.

But it is such an important part of undermining the panic habit that we have given it a separate heading of its own. 
It is important because for everyone who I have come across who experienced the panic habit,
